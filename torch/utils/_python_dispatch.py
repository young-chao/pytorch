# TODO: Limitations and things about enable_torch_dispatch_mode we should fix before exposing it:
# - We need a better user-facing api for torch._C._DisableTorchDispatch that
#   is able to selectively disable __torch_dispatch__ of a particular class.
# - It doesn't work with the tensor constructors (torch.tensor, torch.Tensor)
# - Better name (see https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/63496#discussion_r694091694)


# Implementation note, since this is based on TorchFunctionMode, this had the
# same dilemma: I had a choice about how much of mode stacks
# to implement in Python versus in C++.  At time of writing, I did not care
# too much about implementation efficiency; however, I do care about making it
# hard for users to implement modes in the wrong way.  In the end, it turned
# out to be possible to implement mode stacks entirely from userland, with the
# C++ API providing only _get_torch_dispatch_mode() and
# _set_torch_dispatch_mode(), so I opted to provide some unsafe C++ bindings and
# have the bulk of the logic for managing the stack in Python, which helped
# simplify the C++ API surface.  It would also have been valid to build in the
# notion of mode stack directly into C++ but in this design it's substantially
# more difficult to interact with it.
class TorchDispatchMode:
    """
    A ``TorchDispatchMode`` allows you to override the meaning of all
    ``__torch_dispatch__`` overrideable functions within a dynamic scope,
    without having to actually create a tensor subclass or manually
    monkey-patch functions in the PyTorch API.  Some common situations
    where you should use a mode:

        * You want to override the meaning of factory functions, or other
          functions that do not otherwise take a tensor as an argument
          (these cannot be overridden with tensor subclasses).

        * You want to override the behavior of all functions without needing
          to wrap your inputs in tensor subclasses; e.g., if you are just
          interested in logging intermediate computations.

        * You want to control the order of execution of various tensor
          subclasses explicitly, rather than implicitly via the return of
          ``NotImplemented``.

    Independent subclasses of :class:`TorchDispatchMode` are compositional:
    modes can be pushed onto a stack using ``with MyMode():``.
    When you call functions in the PyTorch API inside your
    ``__torch_dispatch__`` implementation, by default, they will forward on to
    the next mode on the mode stack.  If you want recursively call back into
    your current ``__torch_dispatch__`` implementation, either explicitly
    invoke ``self.__torch_dispatch__(...)``, or use the context manager
    ``__torch_dispatch__(self)`` to make PyTorch
    API self-referential (beware of infinite loops, in this case!)
